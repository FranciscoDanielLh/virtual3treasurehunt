# Treasure Hunt App

Welcome to the Treasure Hunt Application repository! This project is a location-based quiz game built with **JavaScript**, **React**, and the **ArcGIS API for JavaScript**.

## Project Overview

This project is an extension of the Season Two project for **Aptos**. In this version, we've enhanced the frontend to be more responsive and added a powerful backend built with **Python** and **FastAPI**. The application uses AI to generate images, mints them as NFTs, and sends them as rewards to the player's wallet upon completing the game.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the development environment for both the frontend and backend of this project.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Fork** and **clone** the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app in development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

### Backend Setup

The backend is developed in **Python** using **FastAPI**. Follow these steps to set up and run the backend:

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.10** or higher installed.
2. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend/fastapi-api
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the backend server using **Uvicorn**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (with npm) to run the frontend development environment.
- **Python 3.10+** to run the backend.
